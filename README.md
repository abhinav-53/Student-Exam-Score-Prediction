ðŸŽ“ Student Exam Score Predictor
This project is a machine learning web application built using Python and Streamlit that predicts a student's final exam score (G3) based on key academic and behavioral features such as:

Study time

Absences

First period grade (G1)

Second period grade (G2)

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The project uses two datasets from the UCI Student Performance Data Set:

student-mat.csv: Data related to Mathematics performance

student-por.csv: Data related to Portuguese performance


ðŸ§  Model
Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor

Training Features: studytime, absences, G1, G2

Target Variable: G3 (Final exam grade)

Model Evaluation:

RÂ² Score (Accuracy)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

ðŸ§¾ Web Application
The app provides:

User Input: Via sidebar sliders for entering student-specific data

Predicted G3 Score: Based on trained model

Real-Time Insights: How the input values compare with dataset averages and impact score prediction

Feature Importance Chart: Visual representation of which factors influenced the prediction

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python

Streamlit

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Seaborn & Matplotlib

R (for data merging)


ðŸ“Œ Educational Use

This tool helps educators and students understand how study habits, attendance, and prior performance affect final exam scores. It can be used to detect at-risk students early and plan targeted interventions.
